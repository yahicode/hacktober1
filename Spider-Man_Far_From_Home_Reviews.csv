0,"I love how they had a different twist on the classic MJ and peter romance.loved the comedy,romance,and the villain Mysterio!.phase 3 was jut full of great movies can't wait to see what marvel has coming!"
1,Took my 12 and 3 year old boys and we absolutely loved the film!!! A must see for sure!!!
2,The movie was awesome. Lot of plot twists and suspicion to keep you drawn in the entire time.
3,"There's a some things in Spider-Man: Far From Home that I personally didn't love. But I got exactly what I wanted from Mysterio, and that was so important to me. It's pretty amazing that the MCU is twenty three films deep, and they're still bringing out this sort of quality. I know this series is not for everyone. But until they start making movies I don't like, I'm gonna keep showing up."
4,"Great vision effect, great villian, and a good change from the same old same old marbel hero movies"
5,"For me it’s like Christmas everything a new marvel movie comes out, and Spider-Man far from home is no exception. I loved this so much and that’s not even talking about the credit scenes!! No spoilers but I had my jaw dropped lots of times during the movie and I was jumping up and down during the credit scenes! I loved it!!!!"
6,Was a great movie tons of action and humor
7,Great follow up to Endgame!  So much fun and great references to previous films!  Stan Lee would be proud!
8,Really enjoyable not as much action but the story was good for this type of movie.
9,"Hands down one of the better Marvel movies lately. Engaging, action packed and to the point. Love the references to End Game. Production wise you can’t ask for more. Great movie!!"
10,Amazing movie!
